AGU Fall Meeting is coming up! Unfortunately a last minute change means I won't be there in person. If you will be there, please have a look at the poster for my second PhD chapter (first abstract below). I am also a co-author on several abstracts coming out of our summer of fieldwork with the Bedrock Critical Zone Collaborative Network team. Looking forward to seeing you there!
