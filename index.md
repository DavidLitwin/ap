# About Me
I am a Ph.D. candidate at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, expecting degree in May 2023. In my work I integrate processes across timescales to understand the hydrological function and structure of the critical zone. I often take a long-term perspective, thinking about how hydrology links climate, tectonics, and lithology to critical zone form and evolution. Understanding landscape history can help better model and manage water and ecosystems today and in an uncertain future.

# Current Research
### *Understanding the coevolution of topography and runoff generation*
<img align="left" width="800" src="assets/img/hillshades.png"><br />
Topography affects how water is stored and released from watersheds, while over long timescales, flowing water shapes topography through erosion and incision of channel networks. Typical landscape evolution models do not have adequate representations of hydrology to capture these feedbacks. In particular, they don't capture the importance of shallow subsurface flow for runoff generation. In my [first PhD paper](https://www.doi.org/10.1029/2021JF006239){:target="_blank"} I coupled hydrological and landscape evolution models and found we showed that hillslope length scales nonlinearly with subsurface transmissivity (permeability times thickness) under the influence of steady recharge (PDF [here](assets\docs\JGREarthSurface-2021-Litwin.pdf)).

### *The emergence of variable source area hydrology*
In my second paper I took this model further, focusing on how the hydrological function of landscapes coevolves with dynamic climate, soil moisture, and groundwater. I'm particularly interested in the emergence of variable source area runoff generation. In other words, I'm interested in knowing why some places evolve to have saturated areas that expand and contract in response to storms, while others don't. We found that coevolution produces a strong relationship between variably saturated area and relief, and where a landscape sits on that relationship is conditioned by subsurface permeability and thickness relative to climate. Preprint will be available soon!

### *Coevolved topography and runoff generation: a paired watershed study*
<img align="left" width="800" src="assets/img/soldiers_delight.JPG"><br />
How does the subsurface affect coevolved topography and runoff generation? This is a central question in [critical zone science](https://criticalzone.org/bedrock){:target="_blank"}, and has implications for how different landscapes will respond to climate change and water stress. Our model makes predictions that subsurface transmissivity is a primary control on topography and runoff generation. I'm making hydrometric measurements, conducting saturation surveys, and analyzing topography of two small watersheds with contrasting lithology to test model predictions.

# Past Research
### *Drainage divide dynamics when point sinks set baselevel*
Steady-state drainage divides fall along the edges of Voronoi polygons separating point sinks, illuminating more general behavior of a simple landscape evolution model. See our poster [here](assets/docs/Poster_Litwin_CSDMS2019.pdf){:target="_blank"}.

### *Understanding controls on the form of flow duration curves*
Mean fluxes, including baseflow, quickflow, and streamflow, alone explain quantiles in the flow duration curve across many environmental settings, suggesting emergent behavior of watersheds. See our poster [here](assets/docs/Poster_Litwin_Meira_AGU2018.pdf){:target="_blank"}.

### *Using electrical resistivity tomography to recover soil properties in a lysimeter*
Soil properties at the Landscape Evolution Observatory in Arizona vary in space and may change with time. Theoretical modeling revealed the impact of measurement noise on our ability to determine soil porosity from ERT surveys.
