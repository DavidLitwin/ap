# About Me
I am a Ph.D. candidate at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland (expected completion 2023). I am interested in the movement of water through watersheds and the effects that this can have on the long-term evolution of landscapes and ecosystems. Understanding landscape history can help better model and manage water and ecosystems today and in an uncertain future. I build and use computational tools, and collect and analyze field data toward this aim.

# Current Research
### *Understanding the coevolution of topography and runoff generation*
<img align="left" width="800" src="assets/img/hillshades.png"><br />
Topography affects how water is stored and released from watersheds, while over long timescales, flowing water shapes topography through erosion and incision of channel networks. Typical landscape evolution models do not have adequate representations of hydrology to capture these feedbacks. In my [first PhD chapter](www.doi.org/10.1029/2021JF006239){:target="_blank"} I coupled a hydrological and landscape evolution model and used a combination of simulations, dimensional analysis, and analytical solutions to explore these feedbacks (PDF [here](assets\docs\JGREarthSurface-2021-Litwin.pdf)). In my second chapter, I am using a similar approach to examine the evolution and emergence of variable source area runoff generation.

### *The imprint of coevolution on runoff generation and storage on watersheds with contrasting lithology*
<img align="left" width="800" src="assets/img/soldiers_delight.JPG"><br />
Landscape evolution is affected by lithology, tectonics, and climate. How do these factors interact to produce the emergent hydrological behavior we see today? I am studying two watersheds with near identical climate but contrasting lithology to understand how this affects storage and release of water. I am collecting hydrometric data, water stable isotopes, and conducting saturation surveys for this project.

# Past Research
### *Drainage divide dynamics when point sinks set baselevel*
Steady-state drainage divides fall along the edges of Voronoi polygons separating point sinks, illuminating more general behavior of a simple landscape evolution model. See our poster [here](assets/docs/Poster_Litwin_CSDMS2019.pdf){:target="_blank"}.

### *Understanding controls on the form of flow duration curves*
Mean fluxes, including baseflow, quickflow, and streamflow, alone explain quantiles in the flow duration curve across many environmental settings, suggesting emergent behavior of watersheds. See our poster [here](assets/docs/Poster_Litwin_Meira_AGU2018.pdf){:target="_blank"}.

### *Using electrical resistivity tomography to recover soil properties in a lysimeter*
Soil properties at the Landscape Evolution Observatory in Arizona vary in space and may change with time. Theoretical modeling revealed the impact of measurement noise on our ability to determine soil porosity from ERT surveys. See our poster [here](assets/docs/Poster_Litwin_Meira_GSA2017.pdf){:target="_blank"}.

### *Exploring patterns of fluid mixing downstream of small stream confluences*
In-stream surveys of temperature, conductivity, and turbidity revealed that mixing lengths at one confluence were shorter than previously thought. See our poster [here](assets/docs/Poster_Litwin_Lewis_2016.pdf){:target="_blank"}.

# Science Communication and Service
* [Water Underground](https://blogs.egu.eu/network/water-underground/){:target="_blank"}\
Starting in 2022 I will be a co-editor of the Water Underground blog hosted by the American Geophysical Union and the European Geosciences Union.
* [Geobites](https://geobites.org/author/dlitwin/){:target="_blank"}\
I write accessible summaries of peer-reviewed hydrology and geomorphology articles for science-curious audiences.
* [American Geophysical Union Hydrology Section Student Subcommittee (H3S)](agu-h3s.org/){:target="_blank"}\
I served on H3S for the two year term 2020-2021, helping to establish their website and blog. Posts on the blog feature early career hydrologists and provide support and community resources.
