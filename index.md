# About Me
I am a Ph.D. candidate at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland. I am interested in the movement of water through watersheds and the effects that this can have on the long-term evolution of landscapes and ecosystems. Understanding landscape history can help better model and manage water and ecosystems today and in an uncertain future. I build and use computational tools, and collect and analyze field data toward this aim.

# Current Research
### *Understanding the coevolution of topography and runoff generation*
Topography is a critical control on how water is stored and released from watersheds, while over long timescales, flowing water affects shapes topography through erosion and incision of channel networks. Typical landscape evolution models do not have adequate representations of hydrology to capture these feedbacks. I coupled a hydrological and landscape evolution model and used a combination of simulations, dimensional analysis, and analytical solutions to explore these feedbacks.

### *The imprint of coevolution on runoff generation and storage on watersheds with contrasting lithology*
Landscape evolution is affected by lithology, tectonics, and climate. How do these factors interact to produce the emergent hydrological behavior we see today? I am studying two watersheds with near identical climate but contrasting lithology to understand how this has affected how they store and release water. Hydrometric data, water stable isotopes, and saturation surveys will be collected for this project.

# Computational tools
Along the way I've built tools for my work that I hope can also benefit the Earth science community. All are open-source, most are well-documented and have extensive unit tests.
* [DupuitLEM](https://github.com/DavidLitwin/DupuitLEM)\
  Modular modeling toolkit for groundwater-driven landscape evolution built with [Landlab](landlab.readthedocs.io/) tools.
* [GroundwaterDupuitPercolator](https://landlab.readthedocs.io/en/master/reference/components/groundwater.html)\
  Landlab component for shallow groundwater flow.
* [HeightAboveDrainageCalculator](https://landlab.readthedocs.io/en/master/reference/components/hand_calculator.html)\
  Landlab component for calculating the height above the nearest drainage point.
* [Spectral solution for hillslope diffusion](https://github.com/DavidLitwin/SpectralDiffusion)\
  An implicit-spectral solution to hillslope evolution using Landlab tools.

# Science Communication and Service
* [Geobites](https://geobites.org/author/dlitwin/){:target="_blank"}\
I write accessible summaries of peer-reviewed hydrology and geomorphology articles for science-curious audiences.
* [American Geophysical Union Hydrology Section Student Subcommittee (H3S)](agu-h3s.org/){:target="_blank"}\
I served on H3S for the two year term 2020-2021, helping to establish their website and blog. Posts on the blog feature early career hydrologists and provide support and community resources.
